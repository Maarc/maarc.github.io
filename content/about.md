I'm Marc, an Application [Archeologist](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/legacy-infrastructure-saqqara-necropolis-world-marc-zottner/), Field CTO and Executive Advisor.

## Background

As former transformation program lead, consulting architect, middleware specialist, and trainer, I have extensive experience in the application ecosystem. Transformation, security, platform, open-source, and architecture are my favorite topics. Over the past years, I co-authored my first eBook ([The Legacy Trap](https://via.vmware.com/legacy-trap/)) and published an audit tool ([Application Portfolio Auditor](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/application-portfolio-auditor)).

Previously, I worked at [VMware Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu), [Pivotal](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu), [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/de), [CGI](https://www.cgi.com/de/de), and [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/de-de).
